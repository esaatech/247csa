Website Chat Widget
Overview
The website chat widget is a reusable, embeddable component that allows visitors to chat in real time with agents. It is designed to be easily integrated into any website and provides a seamless, real-time chat experience using Django Channels and WebSockets.
Workflow
1. Session Initialization (Before WebSocket Connection)
Why?
To ensure every user’s chat is tracked and messages are grouped correctly, we first establish a unique chat session for each browser.
How?
When the widget loads, it checks for a browser_session_id in the browser’s localStorage.
If not present, it generates a new one and saves it.
The widget then sends a POST request to the backend to either create or retrieve a ChatSession for this browser session.
Frontend Example:
// On widget load
const browserSessionId = getOrCreateBrowserSessionId();
fetch(`/platform_connections/widget/chat/${connectionId}/init_session/`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-CSRFToken': getCookie('csrftoken') },
    body: JSON.stringify({ browser_session_id: browserSessionId })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
    // Save session_id for later use
    window.chatSessionId = data.session_id;
});

@csrf_exempt
@require_POST
def init_chat_session(request, connection_id):
    # Get or create a ChatSession for the browser_session_id
    ...
    return JsonResponse({'session_id': str(chat_session.id)})



2. WebSocket Connection (When User Opens Chat)
Why?
To enable real-time, two-way communication, we use WebSockets. However, we only open the WebSocket after the session is initialized and the user interacts with the widget (e.g., clicks the chat icon).
How?
When the user clicks the chat icon, the widget opens a WebSocket connection to /ws/chat/<session_id>/.
The widget joins the chat session group on the backend.
Frontend Example:


// When user opens chat
const ws_scheme = window.location.protocol === "https:" ? "wss" : "ws";
const socket = new WebSocket(`${ws_scheme}://${window.location.host}/ws/chat/${window.chatSessionId}/`);

class ChatConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        self.session_id = self.scope['url_route']['kwargs']['session_id']
        self.room_group_name = f'chat_{self.session_id}'
        await self.channel_layer.group_add(self.room_group_name, self.channel_name)
        await self.accept()


3. Sending and Receiving Messages
Sending:
When the user sends a message, it is sent through the WebSocket to the backend, which saves it and broadcasts it to all clients in the session (including the agent).
Receiving:
When a message is received from the backend (from the agent or another user), it is displayed in the chat window in real time.
Frontend Example:        
// Send message
socket.send(JSON.stringify({ 'message': message, 'is_user': true }));

// Receive message
socket.onmessage = function(e) {
    const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
    addMessageToChat(data.message, data.is_user);
};

async def receive(self, text_data):
    # Save message and broadcast to group
    ...
    await self.channel_layer.group_send(
        self.room_group_name,
        {
            'type': 'chat_message',
            'message': message,
            'is_user': is_user
        }
    )

async def chat_message(self, event):
    await self.send(text_data=json.dumps({
        'message': event['message'],
        'is_user': event['is_user']
    }))

Key Architectural Decisions
Session Initialization Before WebSocket:
We always initialize the chat session via a REST endpoint before opening the WebSocket. This ensures the backend can track and group messages by session, and the WebSocket always has a valid session ID.
WebSocket Only After User Interaction:
The WebSocket is only opened when the user actually opens the chat, reducing unnecessary server load and connections.
Messages Only Added When Received from Server:
To prevent duplicates and ensure consistency, messages are only displayed in the chat window when received from the server via WebSocket.

REAL-TIME SESSION LIST UPDATES FOR AGENTS 

The agent dashboard features a live-updating list of active chat sessions. When a new user starts a chat, the session list in the agent’s sidebar updates instantly—no page refresh required. This is achieved using a WebSocket connection between the agent dashboard and the backend.     


How It Works
1. WebSocket Connection
When the agent dashboard loads, a WebSocket connection is opened to /ws/agent_dashboard/.
This connection is established by a small JavaScript snippet in the sidebar of detail.html:


(function() {
    const dashboardSocket = new WebSocket(
        (window.location.protocol === "https:" ? "wss://" : "ws://") +
        window.location.host +
        "/ws/agent_dashboard/"
    );
    dashboardSocket.onmessage = function(e) {
        const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
        if (data.event === 'new_session') {
            // Trigger an HTMX refresh of the session list
            htmx.ajax('GET', '{% url "platform_connections:chat_session_list" csa.id %}', '#sessionList');
        }
    };
})();


⌘K to generate a command
i am just worried about the overhead say we have 300 clients have the dashboard open ?

Your concern is very valid! Here’s a practical breakdown of what happens with 300 agent dashboards open using either WebSocket or SSE for real-time session list updates:
WebSocket Overhead (300 Clients)
Each dashboard holds a persistent TCP connection to your server.
Django Channels (with Daphne/Uvicorn + ASGI) can handle hundreds or thousands of WebSocket connections, but:
Each connection uses some memory and a file descriptor.
If you use the default InMemoryChannelLayer, it is not suitable for production with many workers or servers.
For production, you should use a Redis channel layer, which is more scalable.
CPU/Network:
If updates are infrequent (e.g., a few new sessions per minute), the actual message traffic is low.
The main cost is the open connections, not the data sent.
SSE Overhead (300 Clients)
Each dashboard holds a single HTTP connection (kept open for streaming).
Django (WSGI) is not ideal for SSE; you need an async server (ASGI) or a WSGI server that supports streaming responses.
Resource usage:
Similar to WebSocket: 300 open connections, each using a small amount of memory and a file descriptor.
Slightly less protocol overhead than WebSocket.
CPU/Network:
Again, if updates are rare, the data sent is minimal.
What Actually Matters?
300 open connections (WebSocket or SSE) is not a problem for a modern server, if:
You use an async server (Daphne/Uvicorn/Hypercorn).
You use a scalable channel layer (Redis for Channels).
You don’t send huge amounts of data per second.
Bottlenecks are more likely to be:
File descriptor limits (can be raised in OS).
Memory usage per connection (usually small).
Channel layer backend (use Redis, not in-memory, for scale).
Best Practices for Scaling
Use Redis as your Channels layer (not in-memory).
Deploy with Daphne/Uvicorn/Hypercorn (not WSGI).
Monitor your server’s open connections and memory usage.
If you expect thousands of agents, consider sharding or load balancing.
For very large scale, consider a dedicated pub/sub system (e.g., Redis Streams, Kafka, etc.).
Summary Table
| Method | 300 Clients Overhead | Notes |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| WebSocket | 300 open TCP conns | Use Redis channel layer for scale |
| SSE | 300 open HTTP conns | Use async server for streaming |
Bottom Line
300 agent dashboards is well within the capabilities of Django Channels + Redis + Daphne/Uvicorn.
SSE is slightly lighter, but both are fine for this scale.
The real risk is using the in-memory channel layer or a WSGI server—avoid those for production.
If you want to go further, I can show you how to set up Redis as your channel layer for production scalability.
Let me know if you want that or have more questions!
ok so based on your observation we can go ahead with using a socket connection. lets do it and implement it in the code 

Great! Here’s how we’ll implement real-time session list updates for the agent dashboard using WebSockets:
Plan
Create a new Channels consumer for the agent dashboard (e.g., AgentDashboardConsumer).
Add a WebSocket route for the dashboard (e.g., /ws/agent_dashboard/).
Broadcast events to the dashboard group when a new session is created or a new message arrives.
Update the frontend to open a WebSocket and update the session list in real time.
Step 1: Create the AgentDashboardConsumer
Let’s add this to platform_connections/consumers.py:
Step 2: Add the WebSocket Route
Let’s update platform_connections/routing.py:
]
Step 3: Broadcast Events to the Dashboard Group
Add a utility function in platform_connections/views.py (or a utils file):
Call this function whenever:
A new ChatSession is created (e.g., in init_chat_session)
A new message is received (optional, for unread badges, etc.)
Example in init_chat_session:
Apply to README.md
)
Step 4: Frontend – Open WebSocket and Update Session List
In your agent dashboard JS (e.g., in the template that renders the session list):
Apply to README.md
;
Summary
Backend: New consumer, new route, and a broadcast utility.
Frontend: Open a WebSocket to /ws/agent_dashboard/ and update the session list in real time.
Would you like me to implement these changes in your codebase now?
ohh just to confirm are we adding the live refresh to agents or sessions ?

Great question!
You are adding the live refresh to the session list on the agent dashboard.
Clarification
Session list = The list of active chat sessions (each representing a conversation with a user) that the agent sees on their dashboard.
Agent list = A list of agents (staff/admins) who are online/available (not what we’re doing here).
What the Live Refresh Does
When a new chat session is created (e.g., a new user starts a chat), or a new message arrives in any session, the backend sends a real-time event to all connected agent dashboards.
The agent dashboard receives this event and updates the session list in real time (e.g., adds the new session, shows a “new” badge, moves the session to the top, etc.).
Summary Table
| Live Refresh Feature | What Updates? | Who Sees It? |
|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| This implementation | Session list | All agents/admins |
| (Not implemented) | Agent list/presence | All agents/admins |
So:
You are adding live refresh to the session list (not the agent list).
Let me know if you want to proceed with the implementation!
i assume step 4 should be applied to left sidebar session of detail.html can you confirm this

Yes, you are absolutely correct!
Step 4 (the frontend WebSocket for live session list updates) should be applied to the left sidebar session list in your detail.html.
How it fits:
The <div id="sessionList" ...> in your sidebar is where the list of active sessions is rendered.
When a new session is created (or you want to update the list), the backend sends a WebSocket event to all agent dashboards.
The frontend JS (running on the agent dashboard) listens for these events and updates the contents of #sessionList—for example, by triggering an HTMX refresh or directly manipulating the DOM.
How to implement:
Open the WebSocket when the dashboard loads (in a <script> in detail.html or a linked JS file).
On receiving a new_session event, update the session list:
Easiest: trigger an HTMX refresh of #sessionList (e.g., using htmx.trigger('#sessionList', 'refresh') and set up a custom event).
Or: directly update the DOM if you want to add the session without a full refresh.
Example:
Apply to README.md
>
In summary:
Yes, apply the live update logic to the left sidebar session list in detail.html.
This will ensure agents see new sessions appear in real time, without needing to refresh.
Let me know if you want a full code sample for this integration!
ok make the change 

The change is complete!
Now, when a new chat session is created, the agent dashboard's Active Sessions sidebar will update in real time without a page refresh.
How it works:
A WebSocket connection to /ws/agent_dashboard/ is opened when the sidebar loads.
When the backend broadcasts a new_session event, the script triggers an HTMX refresh of #sessionList, so the new session appears instantly for all agents.
You can further expand this to handle other events (like new messages or badges) in the same way.
Let me know if you want to test, tweak, or extend this functionality!
ok write the docs for readme for this and explain it 

Here’s a clear, professional section for your README.md that documents the real-time session list updates for the agent dashboard using WebSockets. This includes an explanation of the workflow, the reasoning, and how it works in your codebase.
🖥️ Real-Time Session List Updates for Agent Dashboard
Overview
The agent dashboard features a live-updating list of active chat sessions. When a new user starts a chat, the session list in the agent’s sidebar updates instantly—no page refresh required. This is achieved using a WebSocket connection between the agent dashboard and the backend.
How It Works
1. WebSocket Connection
When the agent dashboard loads, a WebSocket connection is opened to /ws/agent_dashboard/.
This connection is established by a small JavaScript snippet in the sidebar of detail.html:
Apply to README.md
2. Backend Broadcasts Events
When a new chat session is created (e.g., a new user starts a chat), the backend broadcasts a new_session event to all connected agent dashboards using Django Channels.
This is done by calling a utility function like notify_agent_dashboard() in the backend, which sends the event to the agent_dashboard group.
3. Live Session List Refresh
When the frontend receives a new_session event, it triggers an HTMX AJAX request to refresh the #sessionList div.
The session list is reloaded from the server, and the new session appears instantly for all agents.


Why This Approach?
No manual refresh needed: Agents always see the latest sessions as soon as they are created.
Efficient: Only a single WebSocket connection per agent dashboard, and only minimal data is sent when updates occur.
Scalable: Works for hundreds of agents, as long as you use Django Channels with a production-ready channel layer (like Redis).

      |
      v
[Sidebar triggers HTMX refresh of #sessionList]
      |
      v

Code Integration Points
Sidebar HTML (detail.html):
Contains the #sessionList div and the WebSocket script.
Backend (views.py):
Calls notify_agent_dashboard() when a new session is created.
Channels Consumer:
Handles the agent_dashboard group and relays events to all connected dashboards.
